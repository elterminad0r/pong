# pong
Pong game inspired by my teacher's warning not to write a Pong game. Has a neon
aesthetic with a sprinkling of Perlin noise and lots of vector calculations.

Handily, you control both paddles so a friend is not required to play. If you
do have a friend, you can quickly swap between who's using the keyboard.
